# PriceKicks - In Progress
An application that allows sneakers secondary market sellers to quickly conduct market research on current prices of products across the two biggest sneakers reselling E-Commerce platforms - StockX and Goat. 

With a quick enter of the product SKU (a unique identification value that comes with all sneakers), the user is able to retrieve a product's lowest "ask" prices - the listing prices by other resellers - for all sizes that the product comes in from StockX and Goat. This data is taken live at the moment of the search, giving the closest reflection of the live relling market at the convenience of a single search. 

In addition, the user is able to save a product to their "favorites" list, which allows them to quickly reference the product's prices from their dashboard without having to re-enter the product SKU. 

Features to be added:
1. Payout table
- provide options for the user to save information related to their seller profile 
- this information will generate a "payout" table that shows the user what their actual payout would be if they were to list their product at the current lowest ask price 
- factors on a seller's profile that contribute to a their payout are: their seller level on StockX, their country of affiliation and seller rating on Goat.

2. Solution for edge cases 
- display a message in the case that a product cannot be found in the StockX/Goat database and give them the option to be redirected back to the index page

This will give the user a more personalized summary of what their individual payout/compensation would look like given that they list a product at it's current competitive listing price on the two giants of the sneakers secondary market.
